Car dealership (part 2)

Starting from the previous homework, we want to add the Repository Pattern as we saw today in the technical demo. We want to have two generic repositories:
  1.EntityFrameworkRepository<TEntity>
  2.MongoDbRepository<TEntity>

We want to improve the previous codebase and use those two frameworks to increase developer productivity.
