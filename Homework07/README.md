REQUIREMENTS:
Imagine you are the owner of an e-commerce website. You have a range of Products, each with its own stock. Your
 customers can see the available stock and make a purchase immediately or save the product as a favorite to buy later. Once
 a customer expresses such interest, and the product is at a price greater than 1000, you need to be able to add a discount
 to it, so that you persuade the client to buy it and seal in the deal.
 You need to model the business using TypeScript and ES6. After creating the model, you should also create a 'sources' file
 which will contain all the test data. You then need to interact with data from services which answer the following criteria:

Products have an overall "likeability", and you need a way to increment that score by one at a time.

Based on likeability score you might want to add discounts to certain products. You need to have a way to facilitate adding
discounts.

In order to fulfill a buy, an order must be placed, with details of both the customer and the quantity of products. This in
turn makes the stock to shrink accordingly.

You need to have a way to refill your stock for a product which is sold out.
