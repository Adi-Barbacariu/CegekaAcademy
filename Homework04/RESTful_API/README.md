Imagine you are the owner of a dealership office. You are responsible for bringing in
 new car models, from different brands, but also orchestrate the vehicles to be sold
 to customers.

Create a RESTful API with the following functionalities:
 - Be able to add, remove and update a new car model specs that the dealership
 supports
 - List all available car models for the customers to see
 - Provide the option for customers to buy a new car of the selected model
 - List all customers with their associated bought vehicles, in a paginated way,
 using one filtering parameter of your choice (car brand, car model, acquisition
 date etc.)

You should use each HTTP verb at least once, accordingly. Also, make use of the
 response codes, keeping in mind all the HATEOAS properties of the API - hint: make
 the endpoints easily discoverable-.
