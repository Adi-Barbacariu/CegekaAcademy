The Epics are ordered based on their priority level, first being the most important and the lastest being the least imporant. The most important part for the user is to be able to create an account and use it in order to organize his informations about his owned cars. 

Then, being able to get notifications based on the status of the cars' documents is an important feature. 

At last, it's a useful feature for the user to be able to view car services around him and also, in case of a problem, to reach for help using this app.
